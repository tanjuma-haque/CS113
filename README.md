# CS113
Computer Science Introductory Course of Fall 2017

This repo has one project from my introductory CS class. I made a Harry Potter matching game and honestly,
it was the first time I had self-discovered multi-dimensional arrays in Java and I remember being very proud when I was done with 
the project. 

The coding style/structure could be a lot better (for e.g.- I could've used more loops ðŸ˜…), but I did this two years ago as part
of my intro course and I did not want to change the files.
